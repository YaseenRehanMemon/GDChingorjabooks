    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Asexual reproduction involves a single parent producing offspring that are genetically identical to itself. It does not involve the fusion of gametes (A), nor does it require two parents (C). Since there's no genetic recombination, it typically does not lead to genetic variation (D), except through mutations.",
