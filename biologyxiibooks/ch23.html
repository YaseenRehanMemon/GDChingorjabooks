                <h2>1. Mendel's Laws of Inheritance</h2>
                <p>Gregor Mendel, through his experiments with pea plants, established the fundamental principles of heredity.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Mendel's Laws</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Law of Segregation:</b> For any given trait, the two alleles an individual has separate (segregate) during gamete formation, so that each gamete receives only one of the two alleles. This explains the 3:1 phenotypic ratio in a monohybrid cross.</li>
                        <li><b>Law of Independent Assortment:</b> Alleles for different traits are inherited independently of one another. The inheritance of one trait does not affect the inheritance of another. This explains the 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio in a dihybrid cross.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>A <b>test cross</b> (crossing an individual with a dominant phenotype to a homozygous recessive individual) is used to determine the unknown genotype of the dominant parent.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="non-mendelian">
                <h2>2. Non-Mendelian Inheritance</h2>
                <p>Not all traits follow the simple dominant/recessive pattern described by Mendel.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Variations on Mendelian Genetics</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Incomplete Dominance:</b> The heterozygous phenotype is an intermediate blend of the two homozygous phenotypes (e.g., red and white snapdragons producing pink offspring).</li>
                        <li><b>Codominance:</b> Both alleles are fully and separately expressed in the heterozygous phenotype (e.g., roan cattle with both red and white hairs; the human AB blood type).</li>
                        <li><b>Multiple Alleles:</b> A gene that has more than two possible alleles in a population, although an individual can only carry two (e.g., the ABO blood group system, with \(I^A\), \(I^B\), and \(i\) alleles).</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </section>
            
            <section id="polygenic">
                <h2>3. Polygenic Inheritance and Epistasis</h2>
                <h3>Polygenic Inheritance</h3>
                <p><b>Polygenic inheritance</b> occurs when a single trait is controlled by two or more genes. This often results in a continuous range of phenotypes, like human height or skin color.</p>
                <h3>Epistasis</h3>
                <p><b>Epistasis</b> is a phenomenon where the expression of one gene is affected (masked or modified) by one or more other genes at different loci. For example, in Labrador retrievers, one gene determines black/brown pigment, but a second, separate gene determines whether that pigment is deposited in the fur at all, resulting in yellow labs.</p>

            <section id="linkage">
                <h2>4. Gene Linkage and Crossing Over</h2>
                <p>Genes located close together on the same chromosome tend to be inherited together. This is known as <b>gene linkage</b>.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Crossing Over</h4>
                    <p>Linkage can be broken by <b>crossing over</b>, a process that occurs during meiosis where homologous chromosomes exchange segments. This creates new combinations of alleles (recombinant chromatids) and increases genetic variation.</p>
                </div>
            </section>
            
            <section id="sex">
                <h2>5. Sex Determination and Sex Linkage</h2>
                <h3>Sex Determination</h3>
                <p>Sex is determined by specific <b>sex chromosomes</b>. In humans and fruit flies, the system is XX/XY:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>XX:</b> Female</li>
                    <li><b>XY:</b> Male</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Other systems exist, like the ZZ/ZW system in birds (where the female is heterogametic) and the XO system in grasshoppers.</p>
                <h3>Sex-Linked Inheritance</h3>
                <p><b>Sex-linked traits</b> are traits controlled by genes located on the sex chromosomes. Most are <b>X-linked</b> because the X chromosome is much larger than the Y.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Characteristics of X-linked Recessive Traits</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They appear much more often in males than in females, as males only have one X chromosome.</li>
                        <li>Affected sons are usually born to unaffected mothers who are carriers.</li>
                        <li>The trait skips generations.</li>
                        <li>Examples include red-green color blindness and hemophilia.</li>
                    </ul>
