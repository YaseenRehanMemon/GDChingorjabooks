                <h2>1. Concepts of Evolution</h2>
                <p>Biological <b>evolution</b> is the process of gradual change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. It is the central organizing principle of modern biology.</p>
                <h3>Early Theories</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Lamarckism (Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics):</b> Proposed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. He suggested that traits acquired during an organism's lifetime could be passed on to its offspring (e.g., a giraffe stretching its neck to reach leaves would have offspring with longer necks). This idea has been largely discredited because acquired traits do not alter an organism's genes.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="evidence">
                <h2>2. Evidence for Evolution</h2>
                <p>The theory of evolution is supported by a vast and diverse body of evidence from multiple scientific disciplines.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Lines of Evidence</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Paleontology (Fossil Record):</b> Fossils show a historical sequence of life forms, with simpler organisms in older rock layers and more complex ones in younger layers. Transitional fossils, like <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, show features of both ancestral and descendant groups (reptiles and birds).</li>
                        <li><b>Comparative Anatomy:</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Homologous Structures:</b> Structures with a similar underlying anatomy due to common ancestry, but which may have different functions (e.g., the forelimbs of humans, cats, whales, and bats).</li>
                                <li><b>Analogous Structures:</b> Structures that serve a similar function but have different evolutionary origins, resulting from convergent evolution (e.g., the wings of a bird and an insect).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Biogeography:</b> The geographic distribution of species. The presence of similar species in geographically separated areas (like marsupials in Australia and the Americas) is explained by continental drift from a common supercontinent, Pangaea.</li>
                        <li><b>Molecular Biology:</b> The universality of the genetic code (DNA) and the similarity in DNA sequences and protein structures between different species provide powerful evidence for a common ancestor.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>3. Darwinism and Natural Selection</h2>
                <p>Charles Darwin, in his book <i>On the Origin of Species</i> (1859), proposed the theory of evolution by <b>natural selection</b>. Alfred Russel Wallace independently conceived of the theory.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Darwin's Key Observations and Inferences</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Overproduction:</b> Organisms produce more offspring than can survive.</li>
                        <li><b>Variation:</b> Individuals within a population vary in their heritable traits.</li>
                        <li><b>Struggle for Existence:</b> Offspring compete for limited resources.</li>
                        <li><b>Inference - Survival of the Fittest:</b> Individuals with inherited traits that give them a higher probability of surviving and reproducing in a given environment tend to leave more offspring than other individuals.</li>
                        <li><b>Inference - Descent with Modification:</b> This unequal ability of individuals to survive and reproduce will lead to the accumulation of favorable traits in the population over generations.</li>
                    </ol>

            <section id="neo-darwinism">
                <h2>4. Neo-Darwinism (The Modern Synthesis)</h2>
                <p>Neo-Darwinism combines Darwin's theory of natural selection with Mendelian genetics. It provides a genetic basis for the variation and inheritance that Darwin observed.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Key Concepts</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Population Genetics:</b> The study of how allele frequencies in a population change over time. Evolution is defined as a change in allele frequencies.</li>
                        <li><b>Hardy-Weinberg Theorem:</b> Describes a non-evolving population where allele and genotype frequencies remain constant from generation to generation, provided that only Mendelian segregation and recombination of alleles are at work.</li>
                        <li><b>Mechanisms of Allele Frequency Change:</b> Natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow are the primary mechanisms that cause evolution.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>Genetic Drift</h3>
                <p><b>Genetic drift</b> refers to random fluctuations in allele frequencies from one generation to the next, especially in small populations. It can be caused by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Bottleneck Effect:</b> A sudden reduction in population size due to a disaster, where the surviving population's gene pool may not reflect the original.</li>
                    <li><b>Founder Effect:</b> When a few individuals become isolated from a larger population and establish a new population whose gene pool differs from the source population.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Speciation</h2>
                <p><b>Speciation</b> is the evolutionary process by which new biological species arise.</p>
                 <div class="card">
                    <h4>Mechanisms of Speciation</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Allopatric Speciation:</b> A population is geographically divided into two isolated subpopulations. Over time, genetic differences accumulate (due to mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift) until they become reproductively isolated.</li>
                        <li><b>Sympatric Speciation:</b> Speciation occurs in populations that live in the same geographic area. It can result from factors like polyploidy (common in plants), habitat differentiation, or sexual selection.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Evolution:</b> The process of descent with modification, where populations of organisms change over generations.</li>
                        <li><b>Evidence:</b> Comes from the fossil record, comparative anatomy (homologous and analogous structures), biogeography, and molecular biology.</li>
                        <li><b>Natural Selection:</b> The primary mechanism of evolution, where individuals with more advantageous heritable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce.</li>
                        <li><b>Neo-Darwinism:</b> The modern synthesis of Darwinian evolution and Mendelian genetics, focusing on changes in allele frequencies in populations.</li>
