    "explanation": "A state function is a property of a system that depends only on the current state of the system, not on the path taken to reach that state. Enthalpy ($\Delta H$) is a state function. Heat ($q$) and work ($w$) are path functions, meaning their values depend on the specific path taken during a process.",
