      "B": "Osmosis",
      "C": "Diffusion",
      "D": "Facilitated diffusion"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Gaseous exchange, such as the movement of oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out of it, occurs primarily through the process of diffusion. Diffusion is the net movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, which is driven by the partial pressure gradient of the gases. Active transport requires energy and moves substances against a concentration gradient, osmosis is the movement of water, and facilitated diffusion involves carrier proteins but is still a form of passive transport, though simple diffusion is the main mechanism for respiratory gases.",
