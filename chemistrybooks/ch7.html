                <h2>Reversible Reactions and Dynamic Equilibrium</h2>
                <p>Most chemical reactions don't just go in one direction. In a <strong>reversible reaction</strong>, products can react to re-form the original reactants. This is represented by a double arrow (⇌).</p>
                <p>A system reaches <strong>dynamic equilibrium</strong> when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. At this point, the concentrations of reactants and products stop changing, but the reactions haven't stopped—they are just balanced, like two people walking on an escalator at the same speed it's moving down.</p>

                <h2>The Equilibrium Constant (Kc)</h2>
                <p>The <strong>Law of Mass Action</strong> gives us a way to quantify the equilibrium state. For any reversible reaction, the ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations (each raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient) is a constant value at a given temperature.</p>

                    <h4>For a reaction: aA + bB ⇌ cC + dD</h4>

                <h2>Le Chatelier's Principle: Shifting the Balance</h2>
                <p>Le Chatelier's Principle is a fundamental concept that helps us predict how a system at equilibrium will respond to a change.</p>

                    <h4>Application: The Haber Process</h4>
                    <p>The industrial production of ammonia (N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃) is a classic example. To maximize the yield of NH₃, the process is run at very high pressure (shifting equilibrium to the right, which has fewer moles of gas) and moderate temperatures (a compromise, since a low temperature favors the product but makes the reaction too slow).</p>

                <h2>The Solubility Product Constant (Ksp)</h2>
                <p>Even "insoluble" ionic compounds dissolve to a tiny extent in water, creating an equilibrium between the solid and its dissolved ions.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>The Ksp Expression</h4>
                    <p>The <strong>solubility product constant (Ksp)</strong> is the equilibrium constant for the dissolution of a sparingly soluble salt. It represents the product of the ion concentrations in a saturated solution.</p>
                     <div class="card formula">
                        <h4>For a salt like AgCl: AgCl(s) ⇌ Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)</h4>

                    <p>A smaller Ksp value means the compound is less soluble.</p>

                <h4>The Common Ion Effect</h4>
                <p>The solubility of a sparingly soluble salt is decreased when a common ion (an ion that is already in the equilibrium) is added to the solution. This is an application of Le Chatelier's Principle, as adding a product ion shifts the equilibrium to the left, favoring the solid reactant.</p>
