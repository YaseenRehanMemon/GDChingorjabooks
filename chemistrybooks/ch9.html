                <h2>Reaction Rates</h2>
                <p><strong>Chemical kinetics</strong> is the study of the speed, or <strong>rate</strong>, at which chemical reactions occur. Some reactions, like an explosion, are incredibly fast, while others, like the rusting of iron, are very slow. Kinetics helps us understand and control these speeds.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Defining Reaction Rate</h4>
                    <p>The rate of a reaction is measured as the change in the concentration of a reactant or product over a period of time.</p>
                     <div class="card formula">
                        <p>Rate = Δ[Concentration] / ΔTime</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h3>The Rate Law</h3>
                <p>The <strong>rate law</strong> is an equation that mathematically links the reaction rate to the concentrations of the reactants. The exponents in the rate law define the <strong>order of the reaction</strong> with respect to each reactant and must be determined experimentally.</p>

            <section id="collision-theory">
                <h2>Collision Theory and Activation Energy</h2>
                <p>For a reaction to occur, reactant particles must collide. However, not every collision results in a reaction. <strong>Collision theory</strong> states that for a collision to be effective, two conditions must be met:</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Conditions for a Successful Reaction</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Sufficient Energy:</b> The colliding particles must have enough kinetic energy to overcome a minimum energy barrier, known as the <strong>activation energy (Eₐ)</strong>.</li>
                        <li><b>Correct Orientation:</b> The particles must collide in the correct spatial orientation to allow bonds to break and new bonds to form.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                 <div class="card">
                    <h4>Activation Energy (Eₐ)</h4>
                    <p>Think of activation energy as an "energy hill" that reactants must climb before they can become products. The higher the hill, the more energy is required for a reaction, and the slower the reaction will be.</p>

                <h2>Catalysis</h2>
                <p>A <strong>catalyst</strong> is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process. It works by providing a different, "easier" reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Catalysts vs. Reactants</h4>
                    <p>A catalyst participates in the reaction but is regenerated at the end, so it doesn't appear as a product or reactant in the overall balanced equation. It simply makes the journey from reactant to product faster and easier.</p>

                <h3>Enzymes: Biological Catalysts</h3>
