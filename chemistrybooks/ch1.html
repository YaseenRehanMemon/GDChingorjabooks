                <h2>What is Stoichiometry?</h2>
                <p>Think of a chemical reaction like a recipe. To bake a cake, you need specific amounts of flour, sugar, and eggs. <strong>Stoichiometry</strong> (pronounced stoy-kee-AHM-uh-tree) is the "recipe math" for chemistry. It's the study of the numerical relationships between the reactants (ingredients) and products (the final cake) in a chemical reaction.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Why is it important?</h4>
                    <p>Stoichiometry allows chemists and engineers to predict exactly how much product a reaction will create, or how much reactant is needed. This is essential in everything from manufacturing medicine to designing rocket fuel.</p>

                <h2>The Mole and Avogadro's Number</h2>
                <p>Atoms are too small to count individually. To solve this, chemists use a unit called the <strong>mole</strong>. It's a specific, very large number that lets us count particles by weighing them.</p>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>The Mole: A Chemist's Dozen</h3>
                    <p>Just like a "dozen" always means 12, a "mole" always means the same number of particles.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>$1 \text{ Mole} = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ particles}$</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This huge number is called <strong>Avogadro's Number ($N_A$)</strong>. So, one mole of carbon has $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ carbon atoms, and one mole of water has $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ water molecules.</p>

                    <h3>Molar Mass: The Bridge to Grams</h3>
                    <p>The <strong>molar mass</strong> is the mass of one mole of a substance in grams. It's numerically equal to the atomic mass on the periodic table. This is how we connect the invisible world of atoms to the measurable world of grams.</p>
                    <p><b>Example:</b> Carbon's atomic mass is 12.01 amu. Therefore, its molar mass is $12.01 \frac{g}{mol}$. This means 12.01 grams of carbon contains exactly one mole ($6.022 \times 10^{23}$) of carbon atoms.</p>

                <h2>Core Stoichiometric Calculations</h2>
                <p>Using the mole concept, we can convert between mass, moles, and the number of particles. These are the most fundamental calculations in chemistry.</p>

                <div class="card formula">
                    <h4>Formula 1: Mass $\leftrightarrow$ Moles</h4>
                    <p>$\text{Number of Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass (g)}}{\text{Molar Mass (g/mol)}}$</p>

                <div class="card formula">
                    <h4>Formula 2: Moles $\leftrightarrow$ Particles</h4>

                    <h3>Calculations for Gases at STP</h3>
                    <p>For gases, it's often easier to measure volume. At <strong>Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP)</strong>, which is $0^\circ C$ and 1 atm, one mole of any ideal gas occupies a volume of 22.4 liters (or $dm^3$).</p>

                <h2>The Limiting Reactant</h2>
                <p>In a real reaction, you rarely have the perfect recipe amounts of all reactants. Usually, one reactant gets completely used up before the others. This is the "limiting" factor for the reaction.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Key Definitions</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Limiting Reactant:</b> The reactant that runs out first and determines the maximum amount of product that can be formed.</li>
                        <li><b>Excess Reactant:</b> The reactant(s) that are leftover after the reaction is complete.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Analogy:</b> If you have 10 slices of bread and 3 slices of cheese, you can only make 3 sandwiches. The cheese is the <b>limiting reactant</b>.</p>

                <h2>Reaction Yield</h2>
                <p>Calculations tell us the perfect, ideal outcome. In the real world, things are less than perfect. This is where we compare our calculated result to our actual result.</p>

                        <li><b>Theoretical Yield:</b> The maximum amount of product you can make, calculated from the limiting reactant. This is the "on paper" result.</li>
                        <li><b>Actual Yield:</b> The amount of product you actually get when you perform the experiment in the lab.</li>

                    <h3>Percent Yield</h3>
                    <p>Percent yield is a measure of a reaction's efficiency. It tells you how close your actual yield was to the perfect theoretical yield.</p>
