                <h2>Properties of Gases</h2>
                <p>Gases are a unique state of matter. Unlike solids and liquids, gases have no fixed shape or volume. Their particles are far apart and move rapidly and randomly, allowing them to expand to fill any container they occupy. This behavior is governed by a set of physical laws that we will explore in this chapter.</p>

            <section id="kmt">
                <h2>The Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases (KMT)</h2>
                <p>The KMT is a model that helps explain the behavior of gases. It is based on a series of assumptions about gas particles.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Core Postulates of KMT</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Particle Motion:</b> Gases consist of tiny particles (atoms or molecules) that are in continuous, random, straight-line motion.</li>
                        <li><b>Particle Volume:</b> The volume of the individual gas particles is negligible compared to the total volume of the container.</li>
                        <li><b>Intermolecular Forces:</b> There are no significant attractive or repulsive forces between gas particles.</li>
                        <li><b>Collisions:</b> Collisions between particles (and with the container walls) are perfectly elastic, meaning kinetic energy is conserved.</li>
                        <li><b>Kinetic Energy & Temperature:</b> The average kinetic energy of the gas particles is directly proportional to the absolute temperature (in Kelvin).</li>

                <h2>The Fundamental Gas Laws</h2>
                <p>Several laws describe the relationships between the four main properties of a gas: pressure (P), volume (V), temperature (T), and the number of moles (n).</p>

                <h2>The Ideal Gas Law</h2>
                <p>The three fundamental gas laws can be combined into a single, more powerful equation known as the Ideal Gas Law. It describes the state of a hypothetical "ideal" gas.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>What is an Ideal Gas?</h4>
                    <p>An ideal gas is a theoretical gas that perfectly follows all the postulates of the KMT. While no real gas is truly ideal, most gases behave very closely to ideal at <strong>low pressure</strong> and <strong>high temperature</strong>.</p>

                <h2>Real Gases: Deviation from Ideal Behavior</h2>
                <p>Real gases deviate from ideal behavior because two of the KMT assumptions are not always true:</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Why Real Gases Deviate</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Real particles have volume:</b> At high pressures, the particles are squeezed so close together that their own volume becomes significant compared to the container volume.</li>
                        <li><b>Real particles have attractions:</b> At low temperatures, particles move slowly enough that intermolecular forces (attractions) become significant and pull the particles together.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The <strong>Van der Waals equation</strong> is a modified version of the ideal gas law that accounts for these factors in real gases.</p>

                    <h3>Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures</h3>
                    <p>The total pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases.</p>

                    <h3>Graham's Law of Effusion</h3>
                    <p>The rate of effusion (or diffusion) of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. In simple terms: <strong>lighter gases move faster</strong>.</p>

                <h2>Plasma: The Fourth State of Matter</h2>
                <p>Beyond solid, liquid, and gas, there is a fourth state of matter: <strong>plasma</strong>. Plasma is formed when a gas is heated to extremely high temperatures, causing electrons to be stripped from the atoms.</p>

                    <h4>What is Plasma?</h4>
                    <p>Plasma is an ionized gas consisting of a mixture of positive ions and free electrons. It is the most abundant state of matter in the universe.</p>
