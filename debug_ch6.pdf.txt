    "question_type": "multiple_choice",

      "A": "4 $\sigma$, 1 $\pi$",

      "C": "4 $\sigma$, 2 $\pi$",
      "D": "5 $\sigma$, 2 $\pi$"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Ethene ($C_2H_4$) has a double bond between the two carbon atoms and two single bonds between each carbon and hydrogen atom. A single bond is always a sigma bond. A double bond consists of one sigma bond and one pi bond. Therefore, there are four C-H sigma bonds, one C-C sigma bond, and one C-C pi bond. Total: 5 $\sigma$ bonds and 1 $\pi$ bond.",
