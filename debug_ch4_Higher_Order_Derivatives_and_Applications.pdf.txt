    "explanation": "If `$f''(c) = 0$`, it is a candidate for a point of inflection. However, it is not guaranteed. For `$c$` to be a point of inflection, the concavity must actually change around `$c$`, meaning the sign of `$f''(x)$` must change from positive to negative or negative to positive as `$x$` passes through `$c$`. For example, for `$f(x) = x^4$`, `$f''(x) = 12x^2$`, so `$f''(0) = 0$`, but `$x=0$` is not an inflection point because `$f''(x) \geq 0$` for all `$x$`, so concavity does not change.",
