Use stoichiometry to find moles of $H_2O$: From the balanced equation, 2 moles of $H_2$ produce 2 moles of $H_2O$. So, 4.0 moles of $H_2$ will produce 4.0 moles of $H_2O$.\n3.

    "explanation": "1. Calculate moles of each reactant:\n   - Molar mass of $N_2$ = 2 \u00d7 14.0 = 28.0 g/mol. Moles of $N_2$ = 28.0 g / 28.0 g/mol = 1.0 mol.\n   - Molar mass of $H_2$ = 2 \u00d7 1.0 = 2.0 g/mol. Moles of $H_2$ = 9.0 g / 2.0 g/mol = 4.5 mol.\n2. Determine the limiting reactant using the mole ratio from the balanced equation (1 mol $N_2$ : 3 mol $H_2$):\n   - If 1.0 mol of $N_2$ reacts, it requires 1.0 mol $N_2$ \u00d7 (3 mol $H_2$ / 1 mol $N_2$) = 3.0 mol $H_2$.\n   - We have 4.5 mol of $H_2$ available, which is more than the 3.0 mol required. Therefore, $H_2$ is in excess, and $N_2$ is the limiting reactant.",
