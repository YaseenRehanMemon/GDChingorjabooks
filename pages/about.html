            <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 fade-in">
                Welcome! My name is Yaseen Rehan Memon, and I'm a 16-year-old college student. I'm a Memon by caste, and like many students, I know how challenging it can be to find the right study materials. This website was born from a simple idea: to make learning easier and more accessible for everyone.

            <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 fade-in">
                The mission of this website is to revolutionize how students interact with their textbooks. Instead of just relying on PDFs, we're converting entire chapters into clean, searchable, and easy-to-read HTML and CSS pages. Our focus is on the Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs), ensuring that every topic is structured to help you study more effectively and understand the key concepts.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-100 mt-8 mb-4 fade-in">Our Motivation</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed fade-in">
                My motivation is not grand, but it is deeply personal. I'm simply a student who wants to build something useful for my peers. This website is a journey to create a resource that adapts to the modern way of learning. I will continue to integrate new content and features to make this a truly comprehensive and helpful tool for your studies.
