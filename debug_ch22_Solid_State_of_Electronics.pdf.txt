      "D": "Superconductors"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Semiconductors exhibit a negative temperature coefficient of resistance, meaning their resistance decreases as temperature increases. This is because higher temperatures provide more thermal energy, breaking covalent bonds and generating more free charge carriers (electrons and holes), thus increasing conductivity. Conductors typically have a positive temperature coefficient, while insulators have extremely high resistance that generally decreases slightly with temperature but not as significantly or predictably as semiconductors.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "An intrinsic semiconductor is a pure semiconductor material without any impurities.

    "explanation": "For a common emitter configuration, the collector current ($I_C$) is related to the base current ($I_B$) by the current gain ($\beta$) as: \n$I_C = \beta \cdot I_B$\nGiven $\beta = 100$ and $I_B = 10 \, \mu A = 10 \times 10^{-6} \, A$.\n$I_C = 100 \times (10 \times 10^{-6} \, A) = 1000 \times 10^{-6} \, A = 1 \times 10^{-3} \, A = 1 \, mA$.",
