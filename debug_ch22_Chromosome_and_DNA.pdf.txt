      "B": "They are identical in sequence",
      "C": "One strand runs `$5'$ to `$3'$ and the other runs `$3'$ to `$5'$",
      "D": "They are composed of different sugars"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The antiparallel nature of DNA means that the two strands run in opposite directions. One strand has a `$5'$ phosphate end and a `$3'$ hydroxyl end, while the complementary strand has a `$3'$ phosphate end and a `$5'$ hydroxyl end. This orientation is crucial for DNA replication and transcription.",
