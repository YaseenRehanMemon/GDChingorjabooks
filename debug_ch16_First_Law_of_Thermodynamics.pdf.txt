    "explanation": "State variables describe the state of a system at equilibrium and do not depend on the path taken to reach that state. Pressure ($P$), Volume ($V$), and Temperature ($T$) are state variables. Heat ($Q$) is a form of energy transfer and is path-dependent, meaning the amount of heat transferred depends on the process undergone by the system, not just its initial and final states.
