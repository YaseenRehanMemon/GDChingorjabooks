      "D": "Held together by metallic bonds"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Ionic solids are formed by electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions. This strong attraction leads to high melting points and hardness. They are typically brittle and are poor conductors of electricity in the solid state (but good conductors when molten or dissolved).",

      "A": "Boyle's pressure",

    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures states that the total pressure exerted by a mixture of non-reacting gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases. Each gas exerts its own partial pressure as if it were alone in the container.",
