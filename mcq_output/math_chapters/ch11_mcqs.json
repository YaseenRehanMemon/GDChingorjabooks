    "explanation": "The rate of reaction is defined as the change in concentration of a reactant or product per unit time.

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The rate constant ($k$) is a constant for a specific reaction at a given temperature. Its value does not change with time or reactant concentration during the course of the reaction. It is highly dependent on temperature (Arrhenius equation). Its units vary depending on the overall order of the reaction.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A reaction intermediate is a species that is produced in an early step of a reaction mechanism and then consumed in a later step. It does not appear in the overall balanced chemical equation. A catalyst is also consumed and regenerated, but it participates in the reaction without being permanently consumed.",
