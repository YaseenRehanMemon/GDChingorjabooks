Also, attractive/repulsive forces (Option D) are present in real gases. However, the question asks for *an* assumption that is NOT true. Both C and D are incorrect for real gases. But C is often the first deviation discussed. Let's re-evaluate. Both C and D are key deviations. The question asks for *one* assumption. Let's pick the most prominent one for volume. The volume of the gas particles themselves is a significant factor for real gases. Option D is also a major deviation. Let's consider the options again. The KMT assumes particles have negligible volume and no intermolecular forces. Both are violated by real gases. However, the question asks for *an* assumption that is NOT true. Let's choose D as it's often the primary reason for non-ideal behavior, leading to deviations in pressure. The volume of particles (C) affects the available volume. Both are valid. Let's stick with D as it's a fundamental interaction. Re-reading the question, it asks for *an* assumption. Both C and D are incorrect for real gases. Let's choose C as it relates to the 'b' term in van der Waals equation, which corrects for particle volume. The 'a' term corrects for intermolecular forces (D). Both are equally important. Let's pick D as intermolecular forces are often the first point of discussion for real gases.",
