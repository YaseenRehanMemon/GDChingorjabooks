    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "This describes the integrated rate law for a first-order reaction. For a first-order reaction, the integrated rate law is `$\\ln[A]_t = -kt + \\ln[A]_0$`. This equation is in the form of `$y = mx + c$`, where `$y = \\ln[A]_t$`, `$m = -k$` (a negative slope), `$x = t$`, and `$c = \\ln[A]_0$`. Therefore, a straight line plot of `$\\ln[A]$` versus time indicates a first-order reaction.",
