    "explanation": "The standard enthalpy of formation ($\\Delta H_f^\\circ$) is for the formation of one mole of a compound from its elements in their standard states. The given reaction forms two moles of $NH_3$. Therefore, to find $\\Delta H_f^\\circ$ for one mole of $NH_3$, we divide the given $\\Delta H^\\circ$ by 2:\n$\\Delta H_f^\\circ (NH_3) = \frac{-92.2 \text{ kJ}}{2 \text{ mol}} = -46.1 \text{ kJ/mol}$.",
