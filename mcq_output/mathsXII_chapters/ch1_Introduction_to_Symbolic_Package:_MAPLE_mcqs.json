    "question_type": "multiple_choice",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The `simplify` command in Maple is used to apply mathematical identities and rules to reduce an expression to a simpler form. For the trigonometric identity `$\\sin^2(x) + \\cos^2(x) = 1$`, `simplify(sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2);` would correctly return `1`.",
