Formic acid (`$\text{HCOOH}$`) has no alkyl group, while acetic acid (`$\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$`), propanoic acid (`$\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{COOH}$`), and butanoic acid (`$\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{COOH}$`) have increasingly larger electron-donating alkyl groups.

    "explanation": "Decarboxylation is the removal of a carboxyl group as `$\text{CO}_2$`. $\beta$-keto acids and malonic acids (1,3-dicarboxylic acids) readily undergo decarboxylation upon heating. Malonic acid (`$\text{HOOC-CH}_2\text{-COOH}$`) is a 1,3-dicarboxylic acid, and heating it leads to the formation of acetic acid and `$\text{CO}_2$`. Other simple carboxylic acids require much harsher conditions or specific reagents for decarboxylation.",

    "explanation": "Acid anhydrides react with alcohols to form an ester and a carboxylic acid. Acetic anhydride (`$\text{(CH}_3\text{CO)}_2\text{O}$`) reacts with ethanol (`$\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH}$`) to produce ethyl acetate (`$\text{CH}_3\text{COOCH}_2\text{CH}_3$`) and acetic acid (`$\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$`). The reaction is: `$\text{(CH}_3\text{CO)}_2\text{O} + \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{OH} \rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOCH}_2\text{CH}_3 + \text{CH}_3\text{COOH}$`.",
