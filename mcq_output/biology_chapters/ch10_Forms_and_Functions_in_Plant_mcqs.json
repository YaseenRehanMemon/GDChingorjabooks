    "question_type": "multiple_choice",
    "options": {
      "A": "Parenchyma",
      "B": "Collenchyma",
      "C": "Sclerenchyma",
      "D": "Epidermis"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Sclerenchyma tissue consists of dead cells with thick, lignified secondary walls, providing strong, rigid support to mature plant parts. Parenchyma cells are living and thin-walled. Collenchyma cells are living and provide flexible support. Epidermis is the protective outer layer.",
