    "explanation": "Cardiac output (CO) is calculated by multiplying heart rate (HR) by stroke volume (SV): $CO = HR \times SV$. \nGiven $HR = 75$ beats/min and $SV = 70$ mL/beat. \n$CO = 75 \text{ beats/min} \times 70 \text{ mL/beat} = 5250 \text{ mL/min}$. \nTo convert to liters per minute: $5250 \text{ mL/min} \\div 1000 \text{ mL/L} = 5.25 \text{ L/min}$.",
