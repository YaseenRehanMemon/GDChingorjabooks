    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Holozoic nutrition involves five main stages: Ingestion (taking in food), Digestion (breaking down food), Absorption (absorbing nutrients), Assimilation (utilizing absorbed nutrients), and Egestion (eliminating undigested waste). Respiration is a metabolic process to release energy from food, but it is not a direct stage of holozoic nutrition itself.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Amoeba ingests solid food particles by forming pseudopodia around them, engulfing them into a food vacuole. This process of ingesting solid particles is known as phagocytosis.
