      "A": "Archaea have a true nucleus, while Bacteria do not.",
      "B": "Archaea lack a cell wall, while Bacteria always have one.",
      "C": "Archaea have different cell wall composition (no peptidoglycan) compared to Bacteria.",
      "D": "Archaea are all pathogenic, while Bacteria are mostly harmless."
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A key distinguishing feature is the cell wall composition. Bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan, whereas archaeal cell walls lack peptidoglycan and are composed of other materials like pseudopeptidoglycan or S-layers. Both are prokaryotes and lack a true nucleus. Many bacteria are pathogenic, but Archaea are generally not known to be human pathogens.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "2 hours is equal to $120$ minutes. If division occurs every $20$ minutes, there will be $120/20 = 6$ divisions. Starting with $1$ bacterium, the number of bacteria after $n$ divisions is $2^n$. So, after $6$ divisions, the number of bacteria will be $2^6 = 64$.",
