    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Oxidative phosphorylation, which includes the electron transport chain and chemiosmosis, generates the vast majority of ATP (approximately 28-34 ATP molecules) during aerobic respiration. Glycolysis yields a net of 2 ATP, and the Krebs cycle yields 2 ATP (or GTP) per glucose.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Fermentation's primary role is to regenerate NAD+ from NADH, allowing glycolysis to continue producing a small amount of ATP in the absence of oxygen. Without NAD+, glycolysis would stop. ATP is produced by glycolysis, glucose is the initial substrate, and pyruvate is the product of glycolysis.",
