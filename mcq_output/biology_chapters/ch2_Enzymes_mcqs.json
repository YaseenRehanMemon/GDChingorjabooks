    "explanation": "Enzymes are biological catalysts, and the vast majority of them are protein molecules. Their catalytic activity is due to their specific three-dimensional structure. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids, while essential biological molecules, do not typically function as enzymes (with the rare exception of ribozymes, which are RNA molecules with catalytic activity, but proteins are the predominant type).",

      "D": "It forms a permanent complex with the product."
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "A fundamental characteristic of catalysts, including enzymes, is that they are not consumed in the reactions they catalyze. After the substrate is converted into product and released from the active site, the enzyme returns to its original state, ready to bind to another substrate molecule and catalyze the reaction again. Options A, B, and D contradict the definition of a catalyst.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Oxidoreductases are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of electrons or hydrogen atoms from one molecule to another, thus facilitating oxidation-reduction reactions. Hydrolases break bonds using water. Ligases join two molecules together, often coupled with ATP hydrolysis. Lyases break bonds without hydrolysis or oxidation, often forming double bonds.",
