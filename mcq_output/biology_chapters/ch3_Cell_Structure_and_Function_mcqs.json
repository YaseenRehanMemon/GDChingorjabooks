    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The Cell Theory states three main principles: 1) All living organisms are composed of one or more cells. 2) The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms. 3) All cells arise from pre-existing cells. Option A is incorrect as prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus. Option C is incorrect as it contradicts the principle that cells arise from pre-existing cells. Option D is incorrect as both animal and plant cells, and all other cells, possess a cell membrane.",

      "D": "Grana"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The inner mitochondrial membrane is extensively folded into structures called cristae. These folds increase the surface area for the electron transport chain and ATP synthase complexes, which are crucial for cellular respiration. Thylakoids and grana are structures found in chloroplasts, and stroma is the fluid-filled space within chloroplasts.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The cytoskeleton is a network of protein filaments (microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments) that extends throughout the cytoplasm. It provides structural support, maintains cell shape, enables cell movement (e.g., amoeboid movement, cilia/flagella), and helps anchor organelles. The cell wall provides rigid support in plants, but not for movement or organelle anchoring.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) is involved in various metabolic processes, including lipid synthesis (e.g., steroids, phospholipids), carbohydrate metabolism, and detoxification of drugs and poisons. Cells that produce large quantities of lipids (e.g., steroid-producing cells) or are involved in detoxification (e.g., liver cells) have abundant SER. Protein secretion is mainly handled by RER and Golgi, ATP production by mitochondria, and photosynthesis by chloroplasts.",
