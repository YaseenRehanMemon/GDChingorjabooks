    "question": "The evolutionary development of seeds provided several advantages for land plants. Which of the following is NOT an advantage of seeds?",
    "question_type": "multiple_choice",
    "options": {
      "A": "Protection of the embryo",
      "B": "Enhanced dispersal",
      "C": "Requirement for water for fertilization",
      "D": "Provision of stored food for the embryo"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Seeds are a major adaptation for terrestrial life, offering embryo protection, dispersal mechanisms, and stored food. The evolution of pollen, which accompanies seeds, eliminated the requirement for external water for fertilization, making option C incorrect as an advantage of seeds.",

    "question": "A plant exhibits the following features: presence of cones, naked seeds, and well-developed vascular tissue. To which group does it belong?",
    "question_type": "multiple_choice",

      "A": "Bryophytes",
      "B": "Pteridophytes",

    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The combination of cones, naked seeds, and vascular tissue is characteristic of gymnosperms. Bryophytes lack vascular tissue and seeds. Pteridophytes have vascular tissue but no seeds. Angiosperms have flowers, fruits, and enclosed seeds.",
