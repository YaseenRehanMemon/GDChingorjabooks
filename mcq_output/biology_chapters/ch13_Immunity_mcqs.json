    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are a diverse group of immune cells that mediate the cellular immune response by processing and presenting antigens for recognition by T cells. Key APCs include dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. Plasma cells produce antibodies, cytotoxic T cells kill infected cells, and NK cells are part of innate immunity.",
