    "question": "A compound has an empirical formula of `$CH_2$` and a molar mass of `$56 \text{ g/mol}$`. What is its molecular formula? (Atomic mass: C = 12, H = 1)",
    "question_type": "multiple_choice",
    "options": {
      "A": "$C_2H_4$",
      "B": "$C_3H_6$",
      "C": "$C_4H_8$",
      "D": "$C_5H_{10}$"
    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "First, calculate the empirical formula mass (EFM) of `$CH_2$`: `$12 + (2 \times 1) = 14 \text{ g/mol}$`. Next, find the ratio `n` by dividing the molar mass by the EFM: `$n = \frac{\text{Molar Mass}}{\text{EFM}} = \frac{56 \text{ g/mol}}{14 \text{ g/mol}} = 4$`. Finally, multiply the subscripts in the empirical formula by `n`: `$(CH_2)_4 = C_4H_8$`.",
