    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Fuel cells, particularly hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells, have been used to provide electrical power and potable water in spacecraft (e.g., Apollo missions) due to their high efficiency and continuous operation as long as fuel is supplied. Flashlights typically use primary batteries, grid stabilization uses large-scale storage, and laptops use secondary batteries.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "In `$HNO_3$`, hydrogen ($H$) is $+1$ and oxygen ($O$) is $-2$. Let nitrogen ($N$) be $x$. `$1(+1) + x + 3(-2) = 0 \\Rightarrow 1 + x - 6 = 0 \\Rightarrow x - 5 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = +5$`. So, nitrogen is in the $+5$ oxidation state.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Reduction is defined as the gain of electrons. Oxidation is the loss of electrons. Disproportionation is a redox reaction where an element is simultaneously oxidized and reduced.
