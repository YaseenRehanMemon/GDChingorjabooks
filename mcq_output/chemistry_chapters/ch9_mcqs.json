    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Molecularity refers to the number of reactant molecules, atoms, or ions that participate in an elementary step of a reaction. \n- It is always a whole number (1, 2, or 3, rarely higher) and cannot be fractional or zero (A is incorrect). \n- It is a theoretical concept derived from the reaction mechanism, specifically for elementary steps, not determined experimentally (B is incorrect). \n- For a complex reaction, molecularity applies to each elementary step. The molecularity of the rate-determining (slowest) step is often used to describe the overall molecularity in relation to the rate law (C is correct). \n- Molecularity is equal to the order *only* for elementary reactions. For complex reactions, the overall order is determined experimentally and may not be equal to the molecularity of any single step (D is incorrect).",
