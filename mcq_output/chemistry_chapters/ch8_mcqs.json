    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The reaction quotient $Q_c$ has the same form as $K_c$ but uses current (non-equilibrium) concentrations. If `$Q_c < K_c$`, it means the ratio of products to reactants is currently too small compared to the equilibrium ratio. To reach equilibrium, the system must increase the concentration of products and decrease the concentration of reactants. Therefore, the reaction will proceed to the right (forward direction) to form more products.",
