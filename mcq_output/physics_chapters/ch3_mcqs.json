    "explanation": "This requires the Ideal Gas Law ($PV = nRT$).\nGiven: `$V = 5.0 \text{ L}$`, `$n = 0.25 \text{ mol}$`, `$T = 25^\\circ C = 25 + 273 = 298 \text{ K}$`.\nUse `$R = 0.0821 \text{ L} \\cdot \text{atm} \\cdot \text{mol}^{-1} \\cdot \text{K}^{-1}$`.\n$P = \frac{nRT}{V} = \frac{(0.25 \text{ mol})(0.0821 \text{ L} \\cdot \text{atm} \\cdot \text{mol}^{-1} \\cdot \text{K}^{-1})(298 \text{ K})}{5.0 \text{ L}}$\n$P = \frac{6.11495}{5.0} \text{ atm} \\approx 1.22 \text{ atm}$.",
