    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The reaction of an alkene with water in the presence of an acid catalyst is called hydration, which is an addition reaction. According to Markovnikov's rule, the hydrogen atom from water adds to the carbon atom of the double bond that already has more hydrogen atoms, and the hydroxyl group ($-OH$) adds to the carbon atom with fewer hydrogen atoms. For propene ($CH_3-CH=CH_2$), the hydrogen adds to $CH_2$ and the $-OH$ adds to $CH$, resulting in propan-2-ol ($CH_3-CH(OH)-CH_3$).",
