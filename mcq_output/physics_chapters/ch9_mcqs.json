    "question": "If the reaction quotient `$Q_c$` for a reaction is greater than the equilibrium constant `$K_c$`, in which direction will the reaction proceed to reach equilibrium?",
    "question_type": "multiple_choice",
    "options": {
      "A": "Forward direction (towards products).",
      "B": "Reverse direction (towards reactants).",
      "C": "No net reaction, already at equilibrium.",
      "D": "The reaction stops."
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The reaction quotient `$Q_c$` has the same form as `$K_c$` but uses non-equilibrium concentrations. If `$Q_c > K_c$`, it means the ratio of products to reactants is currently too high compared to the equilibrium state. To reach equilibrium, the system must decrease the concentration of products and increase the concentration of reactants. This is achieved by the reaction proceeding in the reverse direction (towards reactants).",
