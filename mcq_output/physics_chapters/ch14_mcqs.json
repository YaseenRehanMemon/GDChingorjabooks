    "explanation": "In `$H_2SO_4$`, hydrogen has an oxidation state of `$ +1 $` and oxygen has an oxidation state of `$ -2 $`. Let the oxidation state of sulfur be `$ x $`. The sum of oxidation states in a neutral compound is zero. So, `$ 2(+1) + x + 4(-2) = 0 $`. This simplifies to `$ 2 + x - 8 = 0 $`, which gives `$ x - 6 = 0 $`, so `$ x = +6 $`.

    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "In most compounds, oxygen has an oxidation state of `$ -2 $`. However, in peroxides (compounds containing the `$O_2^{2-}$` ion), each oxygen atom has an oxidation state of `$ -1 $`. For example, in `$H_2O_2$`, hydrogen is `$ +1 $`, so `$ 2(+1) + 2(x) = 0 \\Rightarrow 2 + 2x = 0 \\Rightarrow 2x = -2 \\Rightarrow x = -1 $`.",

      "A": "It requires frequent recharging.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that converts the chemical energy from a fuel (like hydrogen) and an oxidant (like oxygen) directly into electrical energy through a redox reaction. Unlike batteries, fuel cells do not need recharging; they continuously produce electricity as long as fuel and oxidant are supplied. They are known for being highly efficient and producing minimal pollution (e.g., water from hydrogen fuel cells). They typically use renewable fuels like hydrogen.",
