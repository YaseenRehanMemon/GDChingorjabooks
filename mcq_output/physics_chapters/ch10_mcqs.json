    "explanation": "Ionic bonds typically form between a metal and a non-metal. Sodium (Na) is an alkali metal, which readily loses an electron to form a positive ion ($Na^+$). Chlorine (Cl) is a halogen, a non-metal that readily gains an electron to form a negative ion ($Cl^-$). Carbon, Oxygen, and Sulfur are non-metals and are more likely to form covalent bonds with chlorine.",

    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "A coordinate covalent bond (or dative bond) is a type of covalent bond where both shared electrons come from one atom. In the ammonium ion ($NH_4^+$), the nitrogen atom in $NH_3$ (which has a lone pair) donates both electrons to form a bond with a $H^+$ ion (which has no electrons). $H_2$ and $CH_4$ have regular covalent bonds, and $NaCl$ has an ionic bond.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "In $PCl_5$, the central phosphorus atom is bonded to five chlorine atoms and has no lone pairs. According to VSEPR theory, five electron domains will arrange themselves in a trigonal bipyramidal geometry.",
