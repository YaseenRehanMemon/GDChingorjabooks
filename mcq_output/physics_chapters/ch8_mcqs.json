    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "In the context of the Law of Mass Action, 'active mass' is synonymous with molar concentration (moles per cubic decimeter or moles per liter) for solutions, and partial pressure for gases. It represents the effective concentration of a substance that is available to react.",

    "explanation": "In the expression for `$K_c$`, the concentrations of pure solids and pure liquids are considered constant and are therefore omitted. For the reaction `$A(s) + B(g) \rightleftharpoons C(g)$`, `$A(s)$` is a pure solid, so its concentration is not included. Thus, `$K_c = \frac{[C]}{[B]}$`.",
