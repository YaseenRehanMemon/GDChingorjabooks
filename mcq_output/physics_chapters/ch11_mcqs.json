This leads to a higher frequency of collisions and, more importantly, a greater proportion of molecules possessing energy equal to or greater than the activation energy. Consequently, the number of effective collisions (collisions leading to product formation) increases, thus increasing the reaction rate.

    "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of a pseudo-first-order reaction?",
    "question_type": "multiple_choice",
    "options": {
      "A": "The reaction is actually first order with respect to all reactants.",
      "B": "One reactant is present in a very large excess, making its concentration effectively constant.",
      "C": "The overall order of the reaction is zero.",
      "D": "The rate constant depends on the concentration of the catalyst."
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "A pseudo-first-order reaction is a reaction that appears to be first order but is actually of a higher order. This occurs when one or more reactants are present in such a large excess that their concentrations do not change significantly during the reaction. Consequently, their concentration terms can be absorbed into the rate constant, making the reaction appear first order with respect to the other reactant(s). Option A is incorrect as it's not truly first order with respect to all. Option C describes a zero-order reaction. Option D describes how a catalyst affects the rate constant, but not the definition of pseudo-first-order. Therefore, option B is correct.",
