    "explanation": "The standard heat of neutralization is defined as the enthalpy change when one mole of $H^+$ ions from an acid reacts completely with one mole of $OH^-$ ions from a base to form one mole of water ($H_2O$) under standard conditions. For strong acid-strong base reactions, this value is approximately constant at $-57.3 \text{ kJ/mol}$.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "An endothermic reaction absorbs heat from the surroundings. This means the products have higher energy than the reactants, and the enthalpy change ($\\Delta H$) is positive. Since heat is absorbed from the surroundings, the reaction mixture typically feels cold to the touch.",
