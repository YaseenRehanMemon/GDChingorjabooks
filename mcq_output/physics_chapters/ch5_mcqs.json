    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "London dispersion forces (also known as instantaneous dipole-induced dipole forces) arise from temporary fluctuations in electron distribution, creating instantaneous dipoles. These forces are present in all atoms and molecules, whether polar or nonpolar, because electrons are constantly in motion. Dipole-dipole forces occur between polar molecules, hydrogen bonding is a special type of dipole-dipole interaction involving hydrogen bonded to a highly electronegative atom (N, O, F), and ion-dipole forces occur between an ion and a polar molecule.",

      "A": "Water has a smaller molecular mass.",

      "C": "Water forms extensive hydrogen bonds.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Water ($H_2O$) has a significantly higher boiling point than hydrogen sulfide ($H_2S$) primarily due to the presence of extensive hydrogen bonding between water molecules. Oxygen is much more electronegative than sulfur, leading to a highly polar $O-H$ bond. This allows hydrogen atoms in water to form strong hydrogen bonds with oxygen atoms of adjacent water molecules. Although $H_2S$ is also polar and has a higher molecular mass (which would suggest stronger London dispersion forces), the absence of hydrogen bonding makes its intermolecular forces much weaker than those in water. Option A is incorrect because a smaller molecular mass usually correlates with a lower boiling point. Option B is incorrect as water is a highly polar molecule. Option D is incorrect because while $H_2S$ has stronger London dispersion forces due to higher molecular mass, these are not as strong as hydrogen bonds in water.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Vapor pressure is inversely related to the strength of intermolecular forces. Substances with weaker intermolecular forces evaporate more easily and thus have higher vapor pressures. Glycerol has three hydroxyl groups, leading to extensive hydrogen bonding and very strong intermolecular forces. Water also forms strong hydrogen bonds. Ethanol forms hydrogen bonds but to a lesser extent than water or glycerol. Diethyl ether, while having a polar $C-O-C$ bond, cannot form hydrogen bonds with itself (it can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor but lacks a hydrogen bond donor site). Its primary intermolecular forces are dipole-dipole and London dispersion forces, which are weaker than the hydrogen bonds in the other options. Therefore, diethyl ether has the weakest intermolecular forces among the given options and consequently the highest vapor pressure.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Capillarity (or capillary action) is the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of, or even in opposition to, external forces like gravity. This phenomenon is due to the interplay of cohesive forces (between liquid molecules) and adhesive forces (between liquid and tube surface). Viscosity is a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow.

    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "For most liquids, viscosity decreases as temperature increases.

However, when molten or dissolved in a polar solvent, the ions become mobile and can carry an electric current, making them good conductors. Option A is incorrect as they are composed of ions.

    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Metallic solids are composed of metal atoms held together by metallic bonds, which involve a 'sea' of delocalized electrons. Copper is a metal and thus forms a metallic solid, characterized by high electrical and thermal conductivity, malleability, and ductility. Sulfur ($S_8$) is a molecular solid. Silicon dioxide ($SiO_2$) is a covalent network solid. Potassium iodide ($KI$) is an ionic solid.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Sublimation is the phase transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas state, without passing through the liquid state. A common example is dry ice ($CO_2$) at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Evaporation is liquid to gas. Condensation is gas to liquid. Melting is solid to liquid.",
