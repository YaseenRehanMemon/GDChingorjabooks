    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity in 1896 when he observed that uranium salts spontaneously emitted radiation that could expose photographic plates. Marie Curie and Pierre Curie later did extensive work on identifying other radioactive elements, but Becquerel made the initial discovery.",
