    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its vapor pressure becomes equal to the surrounding atmospheric pressure. At this point, bubbles of vapor can form throughout the liquid, not just at the surface. Melting and freezing points relate to solid-liquid transitions. Critical temperature is the temperature above which a gas cannot be liquefied, no matter how much pressure is applied.",
