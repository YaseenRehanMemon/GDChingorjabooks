    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Iron is a classic example of a ferromagnetic material. Ferromagnetic materials possess magnetic domains, which are regions where atomic magnetic moments are aligned. In the presence of an external magnetic field, these domains align, leading to strong magnetization. Copper and aluminum are paramagnetic (weakly attracted), and water is diamagnetic (weakly repelled).",
