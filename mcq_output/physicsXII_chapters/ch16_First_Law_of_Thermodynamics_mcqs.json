    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "For an ideal gas, the internal energy (`$U$`) is entirely kinetic energy associated with the random motion of its molecules. This kinetic energy is directly proportional to the absolute temperature (`$T$`) of the gas. Therefore, the internal energy of an ideal gas depends solely on its temperature.",

    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "In an adiabatic expansion, the gas does work *on* the surroundings (`$W > 0$`) without any heat exchange (`$Q = 0$`). According to the First Law, `$\\Delta U = Q - W = 0 - W = -W$`. Since `$W > 0$`, `$\\Delta U$` is negative, meaning the internal energy of the gas decreases. A decrease in internal energy for an ideal gas implies a decrease in temperature.",
