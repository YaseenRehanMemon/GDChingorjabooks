      "C": "Neutron",

    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "A particle is its own antiparticle if it has no distinguishing quantum numbers (like charge, baryon number, lepton number, strangeness) that are opposite for its antiparticle. The photon has zero charge, zero baryon number, zero lepton number, and zero strangeness, making it its own antiparticle. Electrons, protons, and neutrons all have distinct antiparticles (positron, antiproton, antineutron, respectively).",

    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Confinement is the phenomenon in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) where quarks and gluons cannot be isolated from hadrons. The strong force between quarks increases with distance, making it energetically impossible to separate them. Asymptotic freedom describes the weakening of the strong force at very short distances (high energies). Color neutrality refers to the requirement that all observable hadrons must be colorless.",
