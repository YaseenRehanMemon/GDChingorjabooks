      "A": "Radio communication",
      "B": "Medical surgery",
      "C": "Heating water",
      "D": "Generating electricity"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Lasers have numerous applications due to their unique properties. In medicine, they are widely used for precise cutting, coagulation, and ablation in various surgeries (e.g., eye surgery, dermatology). Radio communication uses radio waves, not typically lasers. Heating water and generating electricity are generally not primary applications of lasers.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, such as position (`$\\Delta x$`) and momentum (`$\\Delta p$`), can be known simultaneously. Mathematically, `$\\Delta x \\Delta p \\ge \frac{\\hbar}{2}$`.",
