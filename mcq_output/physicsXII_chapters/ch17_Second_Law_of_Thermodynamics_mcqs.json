    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The Third Law of Thermodynamics states that the entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero temperature ($0\\,K$) is zero. Option A is the First Law. Option C is the Clausius statement of the Second Law. Option D is a consequence of the Third Law, often referred to as the unattainability principle.",
