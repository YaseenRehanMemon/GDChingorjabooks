    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "If `$16\\%$` of individuals express the recessive phenotype, then the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (`$q^2$`) is `$0.16$`. Therefore, the frequency of the recessive allele (`$q$`) is `$\\sqrt{0.16} = 0.4$`. Using `$p + q = 1$`, the frequency of the dominant allele (`$p$`) is `$1 - 0.4 = 0.6$`. The frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype (`$p^2$`) is `$0.6^2 = 0.36$`. Option A is `$q^2$`, Option C is `$2pq$`, and Option D is incorrect.",
