    "question_type": "multiple_choice",
    "options": {
      "A": "High cost of treatment",

    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Germline gene therapy involves altering the genes in germ cells (sperm or egg), meaning that the genetic changes would be passed on to all future generations. This raises significant ethical concerns about unintended consequences, the concept of 'designer babies,' and altering the human gene pool without full understanding of long-term effects. Somatic gene therapy, in contrast, affects only the treated individual and is not heritable.",
