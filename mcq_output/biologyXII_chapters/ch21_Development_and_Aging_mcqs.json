    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Gastrulation is a critical stage in early embryonic development during which the single-layered blastula is reorganized into a trilaminar (three-layered) structure known as the gastrula. These three layers are the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, which will eventually give rise to all the tissues and organs of the body. Rapid cell division is cleavage, attachment is implantation, and neural tube development is neurulation.",
