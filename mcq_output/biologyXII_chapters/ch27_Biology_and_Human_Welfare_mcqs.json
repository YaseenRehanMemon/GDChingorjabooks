    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Tissue culture (micropropagation) allows for the rapid production of a large number of genetically identical plants (clones) from a small piece of plant tissue. A significant advantage is the ability to produce disease-free plants, as the meristematic tissue used is often free of viruses. It requires minimal space and can be done year-round, independent of seasons.",
