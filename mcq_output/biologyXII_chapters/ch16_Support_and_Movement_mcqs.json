    "explanation": "The primary functions of the human skeleton include providing support for the body, protecting vital organs, and facilitating movement. While bones do produce some hormones (e.g., osteocalcin), hormone production is not considered a primary function of the skeletal system in the same way as support, protection, and movement. Major hormone production occurs in endocrine glands.",

While the exoskeleton of insects is primarily composed of chitin, 'chitinous skeleton' describes its composition rather than its type of skeletal system. An endoskeleton is internal (like in vertebrates), and a hydrostatic skeleton relies on fluid pressure (like in earthworms).",

    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "The 'all-or-none' principle states that a single muscle fiber, when stimulated by a motor neuron, will contract maximally or not at all. The strength of contraction of a whole muscle depends on the number of muscle fibers recruited and the frequency of stimulation, not on individual fiber strength. A motor unit also follows this principle in that all fibers within *that* unit contract maximally, but the principle fundamentally applies to the individual fiber.",

    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Compact bone is dense and organized into structural units called osteons (Haversian systems), which consist of concentric lamellae around a central Haversian canal. Trabeculae are characteristic of spongy bone. While compact bone does contain marrow cavities, red marrow is primarily found in spongy bone in adults. Its structure is dense, not lightweight and porous.",
