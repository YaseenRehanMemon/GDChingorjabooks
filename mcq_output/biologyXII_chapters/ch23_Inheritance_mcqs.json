    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "In a cross between two heterozygous parents (`$Aa \times Aa$`), the possible genotypes are `$AA$`, `$Aa$`, `$Aa$`, and `$aa$`. The probability of `$aa$` is `$1$ out of $4$`, which is `$0.25$` or `$25\\%$`. This corresponds to the `$1:2:1$` genotypic ratio.",
