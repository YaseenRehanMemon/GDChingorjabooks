    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "High TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone) and low `$T_3$/$T_4$` (thyroid hormones) indicate primary hypothyroidism. This means the thyroid gland itself is not producing enough hormones, so the pituitary gland is working harder (secreting more TSH) to try and stimulate it. In secondary hypothyroidism, both TSH and `$T_3$/$T_4$` would be low, indicating a problem with the pituitary or hypothalamus.",
