    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Biomagnification (or bioamplification) is the increase in concentration of a pollutant (e.g., DDT, mercury) in organisms at successively higher trophic levels in a food chain. Bioaccumulation is the accumulation within a single organism.",

    "question": "If a food chain consists of producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, and tertiary consumers, and the producers have `$10,000$` units of energy, how much energy is typically available to the secondary consumers?",

    },
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "According to the `$10\\%$` rule of energy transfer in ecosystems, only about `$10\\%$` of the energy from one trophic level is transferred to the next. \n\nProducers: `$10,000$ units`\nPrimary Consumers: `$10,000 \times 0.10 = 1,000$ units`\nSecondary Consumers: `$1,000 \times 0.10 = 100$ units`\n\nTherefore, secondary consumers receive approximately `$100$` units of energy.",
