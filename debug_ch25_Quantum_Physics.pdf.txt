    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "According to Bohr's model, the energy of an electron in the `$n^{th}$` orbit (`$E_n$`) of a hydrogen atom is given by `$E_n = -\\frac{13.6 \\\, eV}{n^2}$`. Therefore, the energy is inversely proportional to the square of the principal quantum number `$n$`. The negative sign indicates that the electron is bound to the nucleus.",
