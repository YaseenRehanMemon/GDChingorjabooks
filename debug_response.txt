    "question": "What is the molar mass of water ($H_2O$) given that the atomic mass of hydrogen is 1 g/mol and oxygen is 16 g/mol?",
    "options": {
      "A": "17 g/mol",
      "B": "18 g/mol",
      "C": "19 g/mol",
      "D": "20 g/mol"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The molar mass of water is calculated by adding the atomic masses of its constituent elements.  $H_2O$ has two hydrogen atoms (2 * 1 g/mol = 2 g/mol) and one oxygen atom (16 g/mol). Therefore, the molar mass is 2 g/mol + 16 g/mol = 18 g/mol.",

    "question": "How many moles are present in 44g of carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) (Atomic mass of C = 12 g/mol, O = 16 g/mol)?",

      "A": "0.5 moles",
      "B": "1 mole",
      "C": "1.5 moles",
      "D": "2 moles"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "First, calculate the molar mass of $CO_2$: 12 g/mol (C) + 2 * 16 g/mol (O) = 44 g/mol. Then, divide the given mass by the molar mass: $\frac{44g}{44 g/mol} = 1 mol$.",

    "question": "If 2 moles of hydrogen gas ($H_2$) react with 1 mole of oxygen gas ($O_2$) to produce water ($H_2O$), what is the limiting reactant?",

      "B": "Oxygen gas",
      "C": "Water",

    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "According to the balanced equation, 2$H_2$ + $O_2$ â†’ 2$H_2O$,  2 moles of hydrogen react with 1 mole of oxygen. Since we have exactly the stoichiometric ratio, hydrogen will be consumed first, making it the limiting reactant. ",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "To express a number in exponential notation, move the decimal point to the right until you have a number between 1 and 10. The number of places you moved the decimal point becomes the negative exponent of 10. In this case, moving the decimal point six places to the right gives 6.78, and the exponent is -6.",
