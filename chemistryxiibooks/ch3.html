                <h2>1. Introduction to Organic Chemistry</h2>
                <p>Organic chemistry is the study of carbon-containing compounds, specifically hydrocarbons and their derivatives. Initially, it was believed that organic compounds could only be produced by living organisms due to a "vital force."</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>The Overthrow of Vital Force Theory</h4>
                    <p>In 1828, German chemist Friedrich W√∂hler synthesized urea, an organic compound found in urine, from an inorganic compound (ammonium cyanate). This landmark experiment demonstrated that organic compounds could be created in the lab, disproving the vital force theory and opening the door to modern synthetic organic chemistry.</p>

                <h2>2. Sources of Organic Compounds</h2>
                <p>Organic compounds are abundant and are sourced from both natural and synthetic origins.</p>
                <h3>Fossil Fuels</h3>
                <p>Fossil fuels are the primary source of many essential organic compounds, especially hydrocarbons.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Coal:</b> A solid fossil fuel derived from ancient plant matter. Through a process called <b>destructive distillation</b> (heating in the absence of air), coal yields coke, coal tar, coal gas, and ammonia liquor. Coal tar is a rich source of aromatic hydrocarbons like benzene.</li>
                    <li><b>Petroleum (Crude Oil):</b> A complex liquid mixture of alkanes, cycloalkanes, and aromatic hydrocarbons. It is refined to produce fuels like gasoline and is a feedstock for the petrochemical industry.</li>
                    <li><b>Natural Gas:</b> A mixture of light hydrocarbons, primarily methane (\( \text{CH}_4 \)). It's a cleaner-burning fuel than coal or petroleum.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Natural Products</h3>
                <p>Many organic compounds are isolated directly from plants and animals. These include sugars (glucose), structural polymers (cellulose), hormones (insulin), and medicines.</p>

            <section id="characteristics">
                <h2>3. Unique Characteristics of Organic Compounds</h2>
                <p>The vast number and diversity of organic compounds are due to the unique properties of the carbon atom.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Key Properties of Carbon</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Catenation:</b> Carbon's unique ability to form long, stable chains and rings by bonding with other carbon atoms.</li>
                        <li><b>Tetravalency:</b> Carbon has four valence electrons, allowing it to form four strong covalent bonds.</li>
                        <li><b>Isomerism:</b> The existence of compounds (isomers) that have the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements, leading to different properties.</li>
                        <li><b>Non-Ionic Nature:</b> Organic compounds primarily feature covalent bonds, leading to lower melting/boiling points and slower reaction rates compared to ionic compounds.</li>

                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Functional Group</h4>
                    <p>A specific atom or group of atoms within a molecule that is responsible for its characteristic chemical reactions. Compounds with the same functional group belong to the same family (e.g., alcohols, which all contain the -OH group).</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Homologous Series</h3>
                <p>A series of organic compounds with the same functional group and similar chemical properties, in which successive members differ by a \(-\text{CH}_2-\) group. For example, the alkanes (methane, ethane, propane, etc.) form a homologous series.</p>

                <h2>5. Reforming of Petroleum</h2>
                <p>Reforming is a crucial industrial process used to improve the quality of gasoline.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>What is Reforming?</h4>
                    <p>The process of converting straight-chain hydrocarbons (which have low octane ratings and cause engine "knocking") into branched-chain or aromatic hydrocarbons (which have high octane ratings and burn more smoothly).</p>
                    <p>This process is typically carried out at high pressure and temperature using a platinum catalyst.</p>

                <p>In 1985, a new allotropic form of carbon was discovered: Buckminsterfullerene (\(\text{C}_{60}\)), commonly known as the <b>buckyball</b>.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Structure of a Buckyball</h4>
                    <p>It consists of 60 carbon atoms arranged in a hollow, spherical shape resembling a soccer ball. The structure is composed of 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons. Buckyballs are used in nanotechnology, electronics, and drug delivery systems.</p>
