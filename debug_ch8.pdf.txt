    "explanation": "The relationship is `$K_p = K_c(RT)^{\Delta n}$`. For this reaction, `$\Delta n = (\text{moles of gaseous products}) - (\text{moles of gaseous reactants})$`.\n`$\Delta n = (1 \ mol \ CO_2 + 1 \ mol \ H_2) - (1 \ mol \ CO + 1 \ mol \ H_2O)$`\n`$\Delta n = 2 - 2 = 0$`.\nSince `$\Delta n = 0$`, `$(RT)^0 = 1$`, so `$K_p = K_c$`.",
