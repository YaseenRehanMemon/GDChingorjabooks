                <h2>The Second Law: The Arrow of Time</h2>
                <p>While the First Law of Thermodynamics tells us that energy is conserved, it doesn't specify the direction in which processes occur. The Second Law provides this direction, often called "time's arrow." It explains why heat flows from hot to cold, and why some processes are irreversible.</p>

                        <p>It is impossible to construct a heat engine that, operating in a cycle, produces no other effect than the extraction of heat from a single reservoir and the performance of an equivalent amount of work. (In short, no heat engine can be 100% efficient).</p>

                        <p>It is impossible to construct a device that, operating in a cycle, produces no other effect than the transfer of heat from a colder body to a hotter body. (In short, heat does not spontaneously flow from cold to hot).</p>

                <h2>Heat Engines</h2>
                <p>A <b>heat engine</b> is a device that converts thermal energy (heat) into mechanical work. It operates in a cycle by taking heat from a high-temperature source (hot reservoir), converting some of it into work, and rejecting the rest to a lower-temperature sink (cold reservoir).</p>
                
                <div class="card formula">
                    <h4>Thermal Efficiency (\(\eta\))</h4>
                    \[ \eta = \frac{W}{Q_H} = \frac{Q_H - Q_C}{Q_H} = 1 - \frac{Q_C}{Q_H} \]
                    <p><b>\(W\)</b> = Work done by the engine<br>
                       <b>\(Q_H\)</b> = Heat absorbed from the hot reservoir<br>
                       <b>\(Q_C\)</b> = Heat exhausted to the cold reservoir</p>
                </div>
                <p>Because some heat must always be exhausted (\(Q_C > 0\)), the efficiency of any heat engine is always less than 100%.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="carnot">
                <h2>The Carnot Engine: The Ideal Limit</h2>
                <p>Sadi Carnot conceived of an ideal, reversible engine operating in a special cycle known as the Carnot cycle. This theoretical engine sets the maximum possible efficiency for any heat engine operating between two given temperatures.</p>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>The Carnot Cycle</h3>
                    <p>The cycle consists of four reversible processes: two isothermal (constant temperature) and two adiabatic (no heat exchange).</p>
                    <div class="card formula">
                        <h4>Efficiency of a Carnot Engine</h4>
                        \[ \eta_{\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H} \]
                        <p>Where \(T_C\) and \(T_H\) are the absolute temperatures (in Kelvin) of the cold and hot reservoirs, respectively.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>This is the highest possible efficiency. All real engines (like petrol or diesel engines) are less efficient due to irreversible processes like friction.</p>

            <section id="refrigerators">
                <h2>Refrigerators and Heat Pumps</h2>
                <p>A <b>refrigerator</b> is essentially a heat engine running in reverse. It uses external work to extract heat from a cold space (the inside of the fridge) and exhaust it to a warmer space (the room).</p>
                <div class="card formula">
                    <h4>Coefficient of Performance (COP)</h4>
                    <p>The efficiency of a refrigerator is measured by its Coefficient of Performance (COP), which is the ratio of heat removed to the work done.</p>
                    \[ \text{COP} = \frac{Q_C}{W} \]
                     <p>For an ideal (Carnot) refrigerator:</p>
                     \[ \text{COP}_{\text{Carnot}} = \frac{T_C}{T_H - T_C} \]

            <section id="entropy">
                <h2>Entropy: A Measure of Disorder</h2>
                <p><b>Entropy (S)</b> is a thermodynamic property that can be thought of as a measure of the disorder, randomness, or unavailability of energy in a system.</p>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>The Second Law in Terms of Entropy</h3>
                    <p>The total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. It remains constant for reversible processes and increases for irreversible (natural) processes.</p>
                    <div class="card formula">
                        \[ \Delta S_{\text{universe}} \geq 0 \]
                    </div>
                    <p>This means that all natural processes tend to move towards a state of greater disorder. This increase in entropy is what gives time its direction and leads to the concept of the "degradation of energy"â€”as entropy increases, the amount of energy available to do useful work decreases.</p>
                </div>
                 <div class="card formula">
                    <h4>Change in Entropy</h4>
                    <p>For a reversible process at a constant temperature \(T\), the change in entropy is:</p>
                    \[ \Delta S = \frac{Q}{T} \]

                <p>The Second Law of Thermodynamics governs the direction of natural processes, introducing the fundamental concepts of efficiency and disorder.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The Second Law states that <b>heat does not spontaneously flow from cold to hot</b> (Clausius) and that <b>no heat engine can be 100% efficient</b> (Kelvin-Planck).</li>
                        <li>A <b>heat engine</b> converts heat into work with an efficiency of \(\eta = 1 - Q_C/Q_H\).</li>
                        <li>The <b>Carnot engine</b> is an ideal, reversible engine with the maximum possible efficiency, which depends only on the temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs: \(\eta_C = 1 - T_C/T_H\).</li>
                        <li>A <b>refrigerator</b> uses work to move heat from a cold region to a hot region. Its performance is measured by the COP.</li>
                        <li><b>Entropy (S)</b> is a measure of the disorder of a system. The Second Law states that the total entropy of the universe always increases or stays the same (\(\Delta S \ge 0\)) for any process.</li>
                        <li>The increase in entropy signifies the "degradation of energy" and provides the "arrow of time."</li>
