                <h2>Atomic Spectra</h2>
                <p>When atoms are excited (e.g., by heating), they emit light. However, they don't emit a continuous rainbow. Instead, they emit light only at specific, discrete wavelengths. This unique pattern of wavelengths is called an <b>atomic spectrum</b>, and it acts as a "fingerprint" for each element.</p>

                        <h3>Emission Spectra</h3>
                        <p>A series of bright lines on a dark background, corresponding to the specific frequencies of light emitted by an excited gas.</p>

                        <h3>Absorption Spectra</h3>
                        <p>A continuous spectrum with dark lines, created when light passes through a cool gas. The dark lines correspond to the same frequencies that the gas would emit if it were hot.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The existence of these discrete spectral lines was a major puzzle for classical physics and a key clue that led to the development of quantum theory.</p>

            <section id="bohr">
                <h2>Bohr's Model of the Hydrogen Atom</h2>
                <p>In 1913, Niels Bohr proposed a quantum model for the hydrogen atom that successfully explained its observed spectrum. He blended classical physics with new quantum ideas.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Bohr's Postulates</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Electrons orbit the nucleus in specific, discrete circular orbits called <b>stationary states</b>.</li>
                        <li>While in a stationary state, an electron does not radiate energy, contrary to classical predictions.</li>
                        <li>An electron can "jump" from a higher energy orbit to a lower energy orbit by emitting a photon of light. The energy of the photon is exactly equal to the energy difference between the two orbits.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <div class="card formula">
                    <h4>Photon Emission</h4>
                    \[ E_{\text{photon}} = hf = E_{\text{initial}} - E_{\text{final}} \]
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Quantized Radii and Energy Levels</h3>
                    <p>Bohr's model predicts that both the radii of the electron orbits and their corresponding energy levels are quantized, meaning they can only take on specific, discrete values determined by an integer \(n\), the principal quantum number.</p>
                </div>
            </section>
            
            <section id="xrays">
                <h2>X-Rays</h2>
                <p><b>X-rays</b> are a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation. They are produced when high-speed electrons are suddenly stopped by a metal target.</p>
                 <div class="card">
                    <h3>Production and Inner-Shell Transitions</h3>
                    <p>When a fast-moving electron strikes a target atom, it can knock out an electron from one of the atom's inner shells (like the K-shell). This creates a vacancy. An electron from a higher energy shell then drops down to fill this vacancy, emitting the energy difference as a high-energy X-ray photon. Because these transitions involve specific inner-shell energy levels, the resulting X-rays have discrete, characteristic wavelengths for each element.</p>

            <section id="lasers">
                <h2>Lasers</h2>
                <p><b>LASER</b> stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. A laser is a device that produces a beam of light with unique properties.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Properties of Laser Light</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Monochromatic:</b> Consists of a single wavelength (one color).</li>
                        <li><b>Coherent:</b> All the light waves are in phase with each other.</li>
                        <li><b>Directional:</b> The light is emitted in a very narrow, concentrated beam that spreads out very little.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <h3>How Lasers Work: The Key Concepts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Stimulated Emission:</b> An incoming photon can stimulate an already excited atom to drop to a lower energy level, emitting a second photon that is identical in phase, frequency, and direction to the first. This is the "amplification" part of the laser.</li>
                    <li><b>Population Inversion:</b> To achieve amplification, there must be more atoms in a higher energy (excited) state than in a lower energy state. This is an unnatural condition called a population inversion, which is created by "pumping" energy into the system.</li>
                    <li><b>Metastable State:</b> A special type of excited state with a longer-than-usual lifetime, which allows atoms to accumulate in that state and makes population inversion possible.</li>
                </ul>
