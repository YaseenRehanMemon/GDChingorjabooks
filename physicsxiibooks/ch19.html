                <h2>Faraday's Law of Induction</h2>
                <p>The core principle of electromagnetic induction was discovered by Michael Faraday. It states that a changing magnetic field through a loop of wire induces an electromotive force (EMF), or voltage, in the wire.</p>
                <div class="card formula">
                    <h4>Faraday's Law of Induction</h4>
                    \[ \mathcal{E} = -N \frac{\Delta \Phi_B}{\Delta t} \]
                    <p><b>\(\mathcal{E}\)</b> = Induced EMF (in Volts)<br>
                       <b>\(N\)</b> = Number of turns in the coil<br>
                       <b>\(\Delta \Phi_B\)</b> = Change in magnetic flux<br>
                       <b>\(\Delta t\)</b> = Time interval</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Lenz's Law: The Direction of the Current</h3>
                    <p>The negative sign in Faraday's Law is crucial and is represented by Lenz's Law. It states that <b>the direction of the induced current is such that its own magnetic field opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it</b>. This is a statement of the conservation of energy; the induced current creates a field that fights the change, meaning you have to do work to create it.</p>

            <section id="motional-emf">
                <h2>Motional EMF</h2>
                <p>An EMF can be induced not just by a changing field, but also by moving a conductor through a constant magnetic field. This is called motional EMF.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>How it Works</h3>
                    <p>When a conducting rod of length \(L\) moves with velocity \(v\) perpendicular to a magnetic field \(B\), the magnetic force on the charge carriers (\(F = qvB\)) pushes them to one end of the rod. This separation of charge creates an electric field and thus a potential difference, or EMF, across the ends of the rod.</p>
                    <div class="card formula">
                        <h4>Motional EMF Formula</h4>
                        \[ \mathcal{E} = B L v \]

                <p>Electromagnetic induction is the fundamental principle behind electric generators and motors.</p>

                        <h3>AC Generator</h3>
                        <p>A generator converts <b>mechanical energy into electrical energy</b>. It works by rotating a coil of wire in a magnetic field. As the coil rotates, the magnetic flux through it changes continuously, inducing a sinusoidal alternating current (AC) according to Faraday's Law.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Electric Motor and Back EMF</h3>
                        <p>A motor converts <b>electrical energy into mechanical energy</b>. It is essentially a generator run in reverse. When a current is passed through a coil in a magnetic field, the coil experiences a torque and rotates. As the motor's coil rotates, it also acts like a generator, producing an induced EMF that opposes the original current. This is called <b>back EMF</b>, and it is crucial for regulating the motor's speed and current draw.</p>

            <section id="inductance">
                <h2>Inductance</h2>
                <p>Inductance is the property of an electrical conductor by which a change in current through it induces an electromotive force in itself and in any nearby conductors.</p>
                <div class="card-container">
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Self-Inductance (L)</h3>
                        <p>When the current in a coil changes, the coil induces an EMF in itself. This is called self-inductance. A component designed to have a specific inductance is called an <b>inductor</b>.</p>
                         <div class="card formula">\[ \mathcal{E} = -L \frac{\Delta I}{\Delta t} \]</div>
                        <p>Energy stored in an inductor's magnetic field is \(U = \frac{1}{2}LI^2\).</p>

                        <p>A changing current in one coil can induce an EMF in a second, nearby coil. This is called mutual inductance.</p>
                        <div class="card formula">\[ \mathcal{E}_2 = -M \frac{\Delta I_1}{\Delta t} \]</div>

            <section id="transformers">
                <h2>Transformers</h2>
                <p>A transformer is a device that uses mutual inductance to change the voltage of an AC signal. It is essential for efficient long-distance power transmission.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>How it Works</h3>
                    <p>It consists of two coils, a primary and a secondary, wound on a common iron core. An alternating current in the primary coil creates a changing magnetic flux in the core, which then induces an EMF in the secondary coil.</p>
                    <div class="card formula">
                        <h4>The Transformer Equation</h4>
                        \[ \frac{V_S}{V_P} = \frac{N_S}{N_P} \]
                        <p><b>Step-Up Transformer:</b> \(N_S > N_P\), so voltage increases (and current decreases).</p>
                        <p><b>Step-Down Transformer:</b> \(N_S < N_P\), so voltage decreases (and current increases).</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Power is transmitted at very high voltages to minimize energy loss (\(P_{loss} = I^2R\)) and then stepped down for safe use in homes.</p>
