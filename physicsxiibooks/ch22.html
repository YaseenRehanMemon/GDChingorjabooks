                <h2>Semiconductors: The Foundation of Electronics</h2>
                <p>Semiconductors are materials with electrical conductivity between that of a conductor and an insulator. Their unique properties allow us to control the flow of electricity, making them the building blocks of all modern electronics.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Intrinsic Semiconductors</h3>
                        <p>These are pure semiconductor materials like silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge). Their conductivity is low and highly dependent on temperature.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Extrinsic (Doped) Semiconductors</h3>
                        <p>The conductivity of semiconductors is dramatically increased by a process called <b>doping</b>, where a small number of impurity atoms are intentionally added.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h3>Types of Doped Semiconductors</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>N-type:</b> Doped with elements that have extra valence electrons (e.g., Phosphorus). The majority charge carriers are <b>negative electrons</b>.</li>
                    <li><b>P-type:</b> Doped with elements that are missing valence electrons (e.g., Boron). This creates "holes" that act as the majority <b>positive charge carriers</b>.</li>

                <h2>The P-N Junction Diode</h2>
                <p>A <b>P-N junction</b> is formed by joining a piece of P-type semiconductor to a piece of N-type semiconductor. This simple device, called a <b>diode</b>, is fundamental to electronics because it allows current to flow in only one direction.</p>
                 <div class="card">
                    <h3>The Depletion Region</h3>
                    <p>At the junction, electrons from the N-side diffuse into the P-side and combine with holes. This creates a thin region at the junction that is depleted of free charge carriers, known as the depletion region. This region acts as a potential barrier.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card-container">
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Forward Bias</h3>
                        <p>When the positive terminal of a voltage source is connected to the P-side and the negative to the N-side, the potential barrier is lowered. This allows current to flow easily through the diode.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Reverse Bias</h3>
                        <p>When the polarity is reversed, the potential barrier is increased. This prevents current from flowing (except for a very small leakage current).</p>

                    <h3>Rectification</h3>
                    <p><b>Rectification</b> is the process of converting alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC). Diodes are the key components in rectifier circuits.</p>

                <h2>Transistors: The Digital Switch and Amplifier</h2>
                <p>A <b>transistor</b> is a semiconductor device with three layers (either N-P-N or P-N-P). It can act as either an electronic switch or an amplifier, and is the fundamental building block of computers and modern electronics.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Transistor as a Switch</h3>
                    <p>A small current applied to the central <b>base</b> terminal controls a much larger current flowing between the <b>emitter</b> and the <b>collector</b>. This allows the transistor to be turned ON (allowing current to flow) or OFF (blocking current).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Transistor as an Amplifier</h3>
                    <p>In its active region, a small change in the base current produces a large, proportional change in the collector current. This allows the transistor to amplify a weak input signal into a much stronger output signal.</p>

                <p>An <b>operational amplifier</b> is an integrated circuit that functions as a high-gain voltage amplifier. It is a versatile building block used in a vast range of analog circuits.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Ideal Op-Amp Properties</h3>

                        <li><b>Comparator:</b> Compares two input voltages and outputs a signal indicating which is larger.</li>
