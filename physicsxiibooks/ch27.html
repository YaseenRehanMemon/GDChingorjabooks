                <h2>The Atomic Nucleus</h2>
                <p>Nuclear physics is the study of the atomic nucleus, its constituents, and interactions. The nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons, collectively called <b>nucleons</b>.</p>
                <div class="card formula">
                    <h4>Nuclide Notation</h4>
                    \[ ^A_Z X \]
                    <p><b>X</b> = Chemical symbol of the element<br>
                       <b>Z</b> = Atomic Number (number of protons)<br>
                       <b>A</b> = Mass Number (total number of protons and neutrons)</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Isotopes</h3>
                <p><b>Isotopes</b> are atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons (\(Z\)) but different numbers of neutrons. This means they have the same chemical properties but different masses. For example, Carbon-12, Carbon-13, and Carbon-14 are all isotopes of carbon.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="binding">
                <h2>Mass Defect and Binding Energy</h2>
                <p>A remarkable discovery in nuclear physics is that the mass of a nucleus is always slightly <em>less</em> than the sum of the individual masses of its protons and neutrons. This "missing" mass is known as the <b>mass defect</b>.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Binding Energy</h3>
                    <p>The mass defect is not actually lost; it has been converted into energy according to Einstein's equation, \(E=mc^2\). This energy is the <b>nuclear binding energy</b>. It is the energy that holds the nucleus together, and it represents the energy that would be required to break the nucleus apart into its individual nucleons.</p>
                    <p>The <b>binding energy per nucleon</b> is a measure of the stability of a nucleus. Nuclei with the highest binding energy per nucleon (around iron, \(^{56}\text{Fe}\)) are the most stable.</p>

                <h2>Radioactive Decay</h2>
                <p><b>Radioactivity</b> is the spontaneous process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation. This process, called decay, is random and spontaneous.</p>

                <h2>Nuclear Reactions</h2>
                <p>A nuclear reaction is a process in which two nuclei, or a nucleus and an external subatomic particle, collide to produce one or more new nuclides.</p>

                        <h3>Nuclear Fission</h3>
                        <p>Fission is the splitting of a large, heavy nucleus (like Uranium-235) into two smaller nuclei. This process releases a tremendous amount of energy and several neutrons, which can go on to cause a <b>chain reaction</b>. This is the principle behind nuclear power reactors and atomic bombs.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Nuclear Fusion</h3>
                        <p>Fusion is the process of combining two light nuclei to form a heavier, more stable nucleus. This process releases even more energy per nucleon than fission. Fusion is the energy source of the Sun and other stars. Achieving controlled fusion on Earth is a major goal of physics research.</p>

                            <li>Mass-energy (the total of mass and energy is constant)</li>

            <section id="radiation">
                <h2>Radiation and Health</h2>
                <p>Nuclear radiation can be harmful to living tissue because it is a form of <b>ionizing radiation</b>, meaning it has enough energy to knock electrons out of atoms and molecules, breaking chemical bonds.</p>
                 <div class="card">
                    <h3>Biological Effects and Dosimetry</h3>
                    <p>The biological damage depends on the type of radiation and the absorbed dose. <b>Dosimetry</b> is the science of measuring radiation dose. The effects can range from short-term radiation sickness to long-term increased cancer risk.</p>
                    <h3>Applications of Radiation</h3>
                    <p>Despite the risks, nuclear radiation has many beneficial uses:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Medical Diagnosis and Therapy:</b> Radioactive tracers are used in imaging (like PET scans) to diagnose diseases. Radiation therapy is used to target and destroy cancer cells.</li>
                        <li><b>Agriculture and Industry:</b> Tracers can be used to study fertilizer uptake in plants, and radiation can be used to sterilize medical equipment.</li>
