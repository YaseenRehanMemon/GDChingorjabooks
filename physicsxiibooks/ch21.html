                        <h3>Crystalline Solids</h3>
                        <p>Have a regular, ordered, repeating three-dimensional arrangement of atoms called a crystal lattice. They have sharp, well-defined melting points. Examples: salt, diamond, metals.</p>

                        <p>Lack a long-range ordered structure. Their atoms are arranged randomly, similar to a liquid. They soften gradually over a range of temperatures. Examples: glass, rubber, plastic.</p>
