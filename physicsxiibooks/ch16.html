                <h2>Core Concepts of Thermodynamics</h2>
                <p>Thermodynamics is the study of heat, work, and energy, and the relationships between them. We define a <b>system</b> as the collection of objects we are interested in, and the <b>surroundings</b> as everything else.</p>

                        <h3>Internal Energy (U)</h3>
                        <p>The total energy contained within a system. It is the sum of the random kinetic and potential energies of all its molecules. For an ideal gas, internal energy depends only on its temperature.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Heat (Q)</h3>
                        <p>Heat is the transfer of energy between systems due to a temperature difference. Heat flows spontaneously from a hotter object to a colder one.</p>

                     <div class="card">
                        <h3>Work (W)</h3>
                        <p>Work is the transfer of energy by mechanical means. In thermodynamics, we often consider the work done by a gas as it expands or is compressed. Work done <em>by</em> the system is positive; work done <em>on</em> the system is negative.</p>

                <p>The specific heat of a substance is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of a unit mass by one degree. For gases, it's more convenient to use molar specific heat, and its value depends on whether the heat is added at constant volume or constant pressure.</p>
