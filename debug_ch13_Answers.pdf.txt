I understand the requirements for generating 100 high-quality MCQs in the specified JSON format, including the detailed schema, difficulty distribution, LaTeX formatting, and comprehensive explanations.

However, the "CHAPTER CONTEXT: PDF content from ch13_Answers.pdf" only specifies the *name* of the PDF. The actual textual content of `ch13_Answers.pdf` has not been provided in the prompt.

To create accurate and relevant MCQs that adhere to all your requirements (e.g., covering all major topics, specific numerical/conceptual ratios, progressive difficulty, and detailed explanations based on the chapter's content), I need the full text of the chapter.

Please provide the content of `ch13_Answers.pdf` so I can proceed with generating the questions according to all your detailed instructions.
