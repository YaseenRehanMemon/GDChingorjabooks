    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The rate of a chemical reaction is influenced by factors such as the concentration of reactants, temperature, presence of a catalyst, and surface area (for heterogeneous reactions). Gibbs free energy change ($\Delta G$) determines the spontaneity of a reaction, not its rate. A spontaneous reaction can be very slow, and a non-spontaneous reaction cannot occur without external energy input, regardless of its potential rate. Thus, $\Delta G$ is a thermodynamic factor, not a kinetic one.",
