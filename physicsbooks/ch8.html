                <h2>Coulomb's Law: The Force Between Charges</h2>
                <p>The fundamental force between two stationary charged particles is called the electrostatic force. Charles-Augustin de Coulomb was the first to quantify this force.</p>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Coulomb's Law</h3>
                    <p>The magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card formula">
                    <h4>Formula: F = \(\frac{k \cdot |q_1q_2|}{r^2}\)</h4>
                    <p><b>F</b> = Electrostatic Force (in Newtons, N)<br>
                       <b>k</b> = Coulomb's constant (&approx; 8.99 x 10⁹ N·m²/C²)<br>
                       <b>q₁</b>, <b>q₂</b> = Magnitudes of the charges (in Coulombs, C)<br>
                       <b>r</b> = Distance between the charges (in meters, m)</p>
                </div>
                <p>The direction of the force is along the line connecting the two charges. It is repulsive if the charges have the same sign and attractive if they have opposite signs.</p>

                <h2>The Electric Field</h2>
                <p>The concept of a field helps us understand how forces can act over a distance. A charge creates an electric field in the space around it, and this field then exerts a force on any other charge that enters it.</p>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Defining the Electric Field (E)</h3>
                    <p>The electric field at any point in space is defined as the electrostatic force that would be exerted on a small positive "test charge" placed at that point, divided by the magnitude of the test charge.</p>
                    <div class="card formula">
                        <b>E = F / q₀</b>
                    </div>
                    <p>The unit of the electric field is Newtons per Coulomb (N/C). The direction of the electric field is the direction of the force on a positive charge.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Electric Field of a Point Charge</h3>
                    <p>Using the definition of the electric field and Coulomb's Law, we can find the field created by a single point charge 'q'.</p>

                    <p>An electric dipole consists of two equal and opposite charges separated by a small distance. Dipoles are important because they model the behavior of many molecules and are fundamental to understanding how materials interact with electric fields.</p>
